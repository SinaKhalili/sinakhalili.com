# Recently

I'm thinking of doing monthly updates
of what I've been up to. I think it's a good to keep myself
posting on the blog. Also, I stole the idea from [macwright.org](https://macwright.org).


# Productivity

I recently started [onepodshop](https://onepodshop.com) with no knowledge of 
Wordpress, Woocommerce, Php, nginx, or basically anything
related to the stack. It's always nice to shock the system. The first day feels like
you're drowning, but then you start to tread water, and then you start to swim. 

Write a few automation scripts and you're aquaman. It's crazy how much you improve
if you just start doing it every day.

You really can get so much done if you start getting the hang of something.

I'm also always shocked at how, instead of getting more done, I just
do nothing with my extra time! Sometimes I fall back on pretending like I worked as
much as possible by pointing to my work hours. The sneaky part is that you need to keep yourself
dedicated to excellence because nobody is going to hold you to that standard. Realistically, I think
I have ~3x worth of output in me unused. I just need to figure out how to get it out.

# Books

This was a great month for reading. I finished three books, all of which
I thouroughly enjoyed.

**The Pheonix Project** by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford

Wow, I was caught off guard by how much I enjoyed this book. At it's
core it's a book about development and operations. But the way
it's delivered is through a story. A fictional setting for some
company "Parts Unlimited" that has a struggling IT department.
The story is told through the eyes of the new VP of IT Operations
who is tasked with turning the department around. 

The story is enjoyable as a story, and it instills some good
lessons about how to run a company. I can truly say it's my favorite
business book I've ever read. I think I might be an operations person
at heart! I'm excited to read the sequel.

**Candide: Or Optimism** by Voltaire

What can one say that hasn't already been said?
This book is a real classic - but don't let that fool you.
It doesn't read like a classic at all. It's super short, hilarious,
and full of adventure. I feel like it could have been written
yesterday on fanfiction.net or something. It's also still
geniuinely funny. I laughed out loud a few times. It's full
of sex & violence, a real page turner.

Highly recommended, espcially if you're the type of person
who doesn't like to read classics.

**No Longer Human** by Osamu Dazai, as interpreted by Junji Ito

This is a manga adaptation of a classic Japanese novel.
The novel follows a protagonist who is deeply disturbed
and alienated from society. He inadvertedly hurts everyone
around him, and is unable to connect with anyone. It's a
very dark story, and the manga adaptation has the trademark
Ito macabre style. Not for the faint of heart, but watching
two masters of the craft work together is a real treat.
