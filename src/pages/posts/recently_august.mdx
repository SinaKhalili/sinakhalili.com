# Recently

Welcome to my monthly update! I'm going to try to do these once a month. 
I've got one down and this one too - so far, so good.


# Productivity

This was a pretty quiet month productivity wise. Just a chiller one at
work, and some super wack google nonsense. Their AI filter randomly decided
to shut down the onepodshop ads _again_. I'm getting pretty fed up with
their silly monopoly. Also, [llamalife](https://llamalife.co/) lost it's
free tier, which is too bad but I understand they have a business to run.

# Books

This was more of a middling month of reading. I got a lot of bits and 
pieces here and there but only finished one book. I once this month found myself stranded without
internet or device and had to read to pass the time, and I kind of
liked the vibe.


**Five Lectures On Psychoanalysis** by Sigmond Freud

In an English class (Intro to Expository Prose) at SFU, I remember my professor saying that of all
the essays he's read, he ranked Freud very highly - claiming that Freud, regardless of whether
his theories are sound or not, had written his favorite essay. 
This came as a bit of surprise to me as
I hadn't ever really heard of Freud as some great essayist, in fact I
even took an "intro to psychology" class and not once did they mention
Freud's skill with the quill. I made a mental note of this at the time
to check out some of his works from his own mouth.

Anyways I finally got around to reading a book about him, called Five Lecture on Psychoanalysis,
whose first chapter you can freely read on the [internet archive](https://ia902907.us.archive.org/17/items/SigmundFreud/Sigmund%20Freud%20%5B1909%5D%20Five%20Lectures%20on%20Psych-Aanalysis%20%28James%20Strachey%20translation%2C%201955%29.pdf)

To be one hundred percent honest, I don't think it's the _best_ essay I've ever read
or anything, but it's surprisingly coherent. It's easy to follow, has some
funny jokes, and kind of goes against the idea that Freud was some stuck up
academic or some woo-woo dream interpreter. 

Note also that these lectures are from a Freud prior to the Oedipal complex,
and instead offer a very first glimpse into the idea of psychology. It's
really quite amusing how excited Freud is at the notion that you can cure
illness simply by speaking about it. Also as the "father of psychology" he
outright claims that he is absolutely not the father of psychology, that he
learned these methods from other doctors while he was working in the hospital
himself.

The five lectures of the book are supposed to introduce the layman to the (then new)  
field of psychoanalysis. In it he lays out the problem: people are suffering from
a disease only described as "hysteria" - a disease with no known medicine or medical
procedure to cure it. Then he presents some experimental data about various
hysteria cases he observed while working with another doctor, Josef Breuer. These
studies were published in a paper called "Studies on Hysteria". Encouraged by
these findings Freud came up with a theory about hysteria: that it is caused by repression
and if we bring that repression to light we can begin to cure it.

Since repressions are, well _repressed_, you cannot simply ask the patient to surface
their deepest repressions. The next sections are Freud's various attempts to unearth these repressions.
They span from hypnosis, repetition, making them tired, and finally to free-association and dream analysis.
You get the impression that Freud really was shooting in the dark so to speak, and seeing him describe
his attempts, both failed and successful, are really quite amusing. Also he draws some
funny and vivid analogies about his theory of mind, like describing the repression as
a rude interrupting student at a lecture who needs to be kicked out of the room, but who keeps
trying to come back in even though we locked the doors.

In the final lecture, Freud describes how he believes all repressions are erotic in nature,
and this is about the time my attention really started to trail off. For as good of a writer
Freud is, I think just binging 100 pages of a subject I only have a passing interest in
kind of dry.

# Addendum

I feel like to actually update my "books" section, I need some sort of an admin
panel. Doing through the source code just feels like a hassle.
