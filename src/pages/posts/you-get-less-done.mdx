# You can get a lot less done than you think

Recently I've tried using the [llama life](https://llamalife.co/) timer to
measure some of my tasks. I think measuring time out like that clarifies
time, much in the same mathematics clarifies thought. You might think 
"something something probability" but until you actually do the math, your
intuitions could be wildly off. This is what rationality is all about -
using math to clarify your intuitions.

Anyways I recently tried mapping out precisely what I was going to work on.
It's easy to think "Oh I'll do that in a few hours" but when I actually sat down
to do it - well a 26 minutes here, 26 minutes there, and wow that's your whole workday.

I guess it's easy to say "I'm going to make a landing page today" but then you break it down
as tasks:
1. Header
2. Footer
3. Body
4. Content
5. Styling
6. Responsive
7. SEO
8. Analytics
9. Hosting
10. Domain

And then you break those down into subtasks:
1. Header
    1. Logo
    2. Nav
    3. Links
... etc


And then you give everything an estimate:
1. Header - 40 minutes
    1. Logo - 15 minutes
    2. Nav - 25 minutes
    3. Links - 15 minutes

And you do it for the whole day's task:

1. Header - 40 minutes
2. Footer - 40 minutes
3. Body - 40 minutes
4. Content - 40 minutes
5. Styling - 40 minutes
6. Responsive - 40 minutes
7. SEO - 40 minutes
8. Analytics - 40 minutes
9. Hosting - 40 minutes
10. Domain - 40 minutes

And then you realize that's 400 minutes, or 6 hours and 40 minutes. 
And you only have 8 hours in a workday. Also at this rate you're working at PACE.
This 6 hour and 40 minute task is realistically going to take you 2 days.


And you do it for the whole day's task:

1. Header - 40 minutes
2. Footer - 40 minutes
3. Body - 40 minutes
4. Content - 40 minutes
5. Styling - 40 minutes
6. Responsive - 40 minutes
7. SEO - 40 minutes
8. Analytics - 40 minutes
9. Hosting - 40 minutes
10. Domain - 40 minutes
