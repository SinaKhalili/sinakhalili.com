*[ [[Category - note taking]] ]*

These are more or less frameworks for creating better, more concise, and more structured notes in order to encourage emergent connections (and then, intelligence).

So far, I've seen a few systems I like to use, and am trying to be active in using them:

### PARA, [explained by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). 
Lessons from Para: 
 * Have different layers of notes
 * Make summaries over a collection of notes
 * Plan your notes
 * Always ALWAYS state **your** takeaways from a piece of information. Don't just paste-quote a book or video or in any sort of way act as a reference source. The source isn't important. Your thoughts are. 

### Andy Matuschak's [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be&stackedNotes=z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc&stackedNotes=z66PNF1Wt4AZ4j7TVEenkvPZgvDcHPuSdJC2r&stackedNotes=z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8)

ðŸ‘‰ Take evergreen notes
ðŸ‘‰ These are notes that are single, reduced, fundamental unit of knowledge. Atomic.
ðŸ‘‰ Note-writing can be skill, and as such starts clumsy and improves over time.
ðŸ‘‰ Write better notes to think better thoughts
ðŸ‘‰ If you have many evergreen notes, you can easily and organically craft a piece of writing or media by stringing together the notes. 
ðŸ‘‰ If you don't have the right notes, you can always write them.
