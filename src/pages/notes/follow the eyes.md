Advice from [In the Blink of an Eye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2141.In_the_Blink_of_an_Eye) which suggests the editing flow follows eyes, and the blinking of eyes. 

Moreover, Murch posits that waking life itself is somehow related the blinking of eyes, that when we are completely entranced then we don't blink, but if we’re not, we blink heavily.

That’s why as an editor it’s absolutely important to follow the eyes when you’re editing. Editing is more about storytelling, and less about technicals.
