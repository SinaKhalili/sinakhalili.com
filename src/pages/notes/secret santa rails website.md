*[ [[Category - Programming]] ][ [[Category - Side Project]] ]*

This december I saw I had some extra time to get some coding done, and at the same time learn [[ruby on rails]] which I've been wanting to learn for a while. 

The site itself is at http://santa.sinakhalili.com (warning: zoomer humour). 

I used [LaTeX.css](https://latex.now.sh/) to give it an overly-academic look while keeping this wack tone. Inspired of course by [[infinite jest]]. 

I hosted it on Heroku, and honestly the Heroku + Rails combo is a real match made in heaven. For hobby projects especially. 

Overall this is my favourite (and most rare) type of side project: 

|Category                                 | Outcome |
|---------------------------|--------|
|  Actual use                        | Yes  (for a secret santa)    |
|   Learned something        | Yes   ([[ruby on rails]])   |
| Time commitment            | 2/5    About a week   |
