> But that’s not so obvious to someone who doesn’t code at all: it’s easy to think coders are people who do all the code you’re not doing — because, to the untrained eye, all code is the same. - [Heydon](https://heydonworks.com/article/reluctant-gatekeeping:-the-problem-with-full-stack/)

We use the word “code” for such a broad amount of tasks, to those who cannot code it seems all the same. 

**It is not**.

It's suited to different archetypes, or at least different mindsets.

As an example, take the three main web technologies:
1. HTML - A metalanguage. Markup. For the writer. Precise use of semantic elements. The structure should be deliberate, not forced or accidental.
2. CSS - The typographer. The designer. Visual intuition.
3. Javascript - The event driven imperative/functional programmer.

You could even add 
4. (Python|Go|Rust|Node|BACKEND) - The distributed systems programmer. 

Although you could group 3 and 4 into “computer scientist”. 

I think it's important to know and [[switch mindsets]] and approaches whenever you're in one of these modes.
