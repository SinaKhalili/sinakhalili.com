Here's one of my favourite [reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3i1vd0/this_coconut_oil_melted_during_a_heat_wave_and/). A user is asking about a honeycomb structure in his coconut oil after an earthquake:

The top answer pointed that this is because the heat and friction created contraction and the points start contracting, and that this has been observed as a geographical phenomena:

So we have a connection! But wait, there's more, not only is this honeycomb structure observed in various places on various scales, it also has basis in maths. The [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is the most efficient area-division among a set of points. These absolutely beautiful diagrams slice places and create psychedelic math-art:

So this curiosity ended up appearing in a bunch of different locations. So we can kind of *feel* there's a Voronoi diagram-ness in the natural structure of things, left to themselves, to uniformly maximize efficiency and strength. There's maybe something about [hexagons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY). 

It feels like a good example of [[abstraction]].
