A backlink is a reference to a page which linked to the current page. For example the page [[Category - Category]] linked to this page in it’s *content*, so it will appear in the backlinks of this page. 

On this website the backlinks section is called **Pages that link here**, and is on the right hand side (or bottom if you’re on mobile).
