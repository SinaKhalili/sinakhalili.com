I love side projects. I think it's the best way to learn and do something. I think adding some structure is good too, since the faster you can go from idea to product, the better your project will be (i.e. [[REPLtition is the mother of leanrning]])

So here I'll try to write some stuff about my side-project process. But first, notes on anther website [[thesephist - how i sideproject]].
