After the rise of Lacan and the rise of [[psychoanalytic film theory]], feminists began to take notice that the pleasures of cinema were arranged for the male. 

The idea of the male [[gaze]] was popularized by the feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey who first identified the gaze in her landmark essay [Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema](https://www.asu.edu/courses/fms504/total-readings/mulvey-visualpleasure.pdf). She cites some examples in Hitcock's films, among them [[Rear window]].

She looked at the pleasures of looking in cinema: who get to look, and why?

Almost always **men**. They are the ones who *carry* the look. We *are* their look. Eyeline match the *men*. 

The audience, because of this binary narrative, only identifies the men because in [[suture]], the filmmaker decides who you identify with, not you. 

And so, Moudy claims, we are encouraged to *look at* women and *be* men.
