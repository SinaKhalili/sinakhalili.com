### The anti-pattern
If you're getting into a new hobby, or perhaps learning the more nuanced version of some existing hobby, there's going to be a *ton* of content online to consume about it. 

This is basically the equivalent of aiming a fire hydrant or a hose (depending on the size of hobby) directly at your own face. 

There's a lot to it that you probably cannot tell. 

If you keep watching more and more videos, with more and more clickbait titles, eventually you will simply get nothing done.

### The solution
To escape from sin you must flee. Instead of learning the thing, *do the thing*. It's a way faster way to learn. Don't watch programming, do programming. Don't watch filmmaking, do filmmaking. Don't watch math, do math. 

Doing is the fastest way to learn for the first time, and teaching is the best way to solidify the learning. Consuming Youtube videos are really some of the most empty calories.
