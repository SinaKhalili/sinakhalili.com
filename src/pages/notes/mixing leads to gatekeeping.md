I refer to difficulty-gatekeeping, where the gate is some task. Gatekeeping could also arise in social or otherwise tribe-y situations.

If some task is sufficiently hard or undesirable and is required in order to do another task, but the second task **could** be done independently (if, say, we could instantly change culture) then the first task is gatekeeping the second.

This is because we are **mixing** what shouldnâ€˜t (or at least does not have to) be mixed.

Examples: 
1. Learning React is gatekeeping CSS developers. 
2. Overt academia is gatekeeping filmmaking (a bit).
3. Language skills gatekeep a whole lotta beans.
