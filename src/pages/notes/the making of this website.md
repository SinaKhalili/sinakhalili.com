This website is built with [letter_smith.py](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith_py), a static site generator that works with markdown files. 

To edit, I'm using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a markdown based second brain type system.

### Design
I'm trying too approach everything with a dark-mode awareness, so that dark mode is a first class citizen (instead of an afterthought). 

One source of inspiration is [Josh Comeau's website](https://joshwcomeau.com/). 

I'm also currently trying to use Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) guidelines. 

### Inspired by

The following sites have great design, which I try to ~~emulate~~ steal:
