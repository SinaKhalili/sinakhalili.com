    <h1>work with me not against me</h1>
    <div><p><em>[ <a href="http://localhost:8000/category---aphorism/" class="wikilink">Category - Aphorism</a> ][ <a href="http://localhost:8000/infocure/" class="wikilink">infocure</a> ]</em></p>
<p>This is one of my favourite and most effective mantras.</p>
<p>I remember working on a <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/">leetcode problem</a> with a friend once, and we both independently came up with two different approaches for a solution. We didn't have time to code it up so we just discussed how our approaches <em>would</em> work.</p>
<p>After a quick explanation, it was quite evident that my proposed algorithm was fundamentally faulty and wouldn't really solve the problem.</p>
<p>For some reason, after the inadequecy of my own proposition was exposed, I unconsciously tried my absolute best to find some fault with my friend's solution. I somehow transformed into the wet dream of the undergraduate-engineering-student-QA-low-pay internship that are plastered over all second-year student job boards. I was handing out edge cases for free, I didn‚Äôt ask to change the code, I didn‚Äôt offer any original thought beyond trying my absolute to break the system.</p>
<p>After a while of this my friend paused and said</p>
<p><em>Dude, work <strong>with</strong> me, not against me</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure why it hit me like a bag of potatoes in the face, but it did. It at once evinced my petulance and invited an opportunity for cooperation.</p>
<p>It is the breakdown-buildup cycle captured in an atomic operation. It is to die and be reborn in an instant.</p>
<p>I promptly started offering solutions, workarounds, and just overall being a better discussion partner. I‚Äôm not sure we ever really wrote the code for that leetcode, but this mantra has stayed with me.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs basically an escape hatch to the double adult stage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis">PAC psychology</a>.</p>
<p>When communications break down, remember this phrase.</p>
<p>Work with me, not against me.</p>
