*[ [[films I have seen]] ]*

[Camera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0260776/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) is a 2000 short film directed by Toronto's own David Cronenberg. I saw it as part of Criterion's [[short and a movie]] selection, paried with of course, Videodrome.

The short is only 6 minutes long, so you should totally go watch it now.

The short is about a veteran actor who is lamenting his career and film in general. He has a few standout lines, like that taking a picture is "capturing the death of a moment".  Which contrasts well to the idea of [[realism |  indexicality]] and works of Andre Bazin. 

He also speaks of a terrible dream he once had, where he sat down to watch a movie and as he saw it he would grow old and withered. He had caught some sort of disease, the movie was making him old extremely fast. He was completely shook.

He takes a pause and then says "now look at me". As though the film community had done him some great diservice (or he to himself), and that all the film had succeeded in doing was remind him of the deaths of many moments, and as such the "disease" he caught in his nightmare was very well aging as an actor. 

In the midst of the monologue, children are slowly learning to operate a heavy old-school camera rig. These small children stand in contrast to the old actor, and by the end of it are able to get a fully working cast and director.

To me, these children represent the future generations of filmmakers. Innocent, willing to learn, and impressively quick to adapt. At the end of the day, there are no pros, they're just doing the best they can one step at a time. Like the rest of us.
