Paper: Catered to Your Future Self: Netflix’s “Predictive Personalization” and the Mathematization of Taste
Author: Neta Alexander

Discussion on [[taste]].

“It’s a matter of taste” did not meant it was entirely subjective.

Pierre Bourdieu: taste is not changing. Taste is classification of the classifier. Showing is the distinguisher is distinguished. It positions someone in relation to others. 

Taste Machine: industry tries to shape taste in order to lift perception of something. This happened to cinema.

Enter netflix and the [[rise of individualism]].  Netflix's algorithm, *Cinematch*, is used to provide individual preferences. Choice is the new standard.

### The myth of personalization

>  The golden role of this new economy can be found **in the tautological slogan** of a 2014 campaign for Motorola’s “Moto X” smartphone: Choose Choice . But what exactly do we choose, when we choose choice? Who—and what—is being excluded from this choice-based utopia?

*Cinematch* uses [[clustering]] and [[association rules]], so naturally it's not a completely individual experience. Nobody wants to share their movie picks but is constantly being affected by other people's movie picks. 

> they confuse the “You” in “Recommended for You” with a unique, complex
individual rather than with a group of strangers who all happened to have made similar choices

Hired screenwriters to tag movies for ML. Over 76k microgenres. Netflix prize announced. Goal: [[Maximize time on platform]].

Catering to your present self makes you live in a forever “now” (not in a good [[being present]] kind of way). *Cinematch* is no longer [[ recommendation takeover | recommending, it's taking over]].

But programmers aren't unethical, long complications (white papers, research, coding, testing, deploying, sharding, etc.) simply blur the ethical concerns. 

This is because [[modularity manages complexity]].

Endless choice is actually [[censorship in disguise]]. 

All black boxes hide [[assumptions]], and in Netflix's case that assumption is “remain in my comfort zone”. 

> The gut feeling is dead; long live the metadata.

We are no longer serendipitously exposed to unique films. 

There is a discrepancy between the perceived “digital utopia” of endless choice and the reality of a shifting, tweaking, recommendation/[[recommendation takeover | taste-shaper]] algorithm. 

You’re not *chosing choice* if your choice is limited to a few billion dollar enterprises.
