Like [[Category - Patterns | patterns]], [anti-patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) are common solutions or approaches to a problem, but **unlike**  patterns, anti-patterns make the problem **worse** or even create new problems. 

If curious, [[difference between anti-pattern and bad habit]].

I originally encountered this as a programming term, where I was linked (repeatedly ðŸ˜…) to this great [python anti-patterns](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/) website.

But now, I think of a lot of things in terms of antipatterns.

Studying anti-patterns is almost as fun as studying regular patterns. I've even invented my own anti-patterns that I see in the wild.

### Python (Lessons I need to learn)
[[not using dict comprehensions]] | [[asking for permission instead of forgiveness]] | [[use zip instead of iterating]]

### Real Life Tropes
These anti-patterns are inspired by one of the [best websites ever](https://tvtropes.org)
[[clown to clown conversation]]: Two people trying to impress eachother with shallow knowledge of a field.
[[unique perspective overconfidence]]: Thinking you have a better grasp because of knowledge in some unrelated field.
[[unconsciously provoked to aggression ]]: Unconsciously flipping a switch to becomming agressive.
[[exploitable position]]: Putting yourself in a position where you may do something contrary to your ideals.
