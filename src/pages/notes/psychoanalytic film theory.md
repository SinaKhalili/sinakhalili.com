*[ [[contemporary film theory]] ][ [[Category - Film]] ]*

Influenced by fellow pseudo-intellectuals (just kidding) [Freudyboi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) and [Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan), film theorists began to take the developments in the field human nature and apply it to film.

### Voyeurism
Pleasure in looking without being seen.

More Freudian, "pleasure in subjecting the *Other* to our [[gaze]]."

To Mr. Wackypants Freud, the gaze stems from the child looking through a keyhole trying to see his parents naked. 

In Cinema, we can fulfill our voyeuristic fantasy by creating the illusion of looking into a private world. Indulging a fantasy.

### Identification
Another Freud, that we all have an innate narcissistic [scopophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopophilia) i.e. we want to see something that looks like *us*. We want to *identify*. 

We're looking at the film to see an identification of the things of film.

Lacan says in his [[mirror phase]] that this is a key moment to recognizing subjectivity. By viewing our own reflection, we can see our place in the world. Our *idealized* subjectivity is *pleasurable* ex. Hero, Rebel, etc. 

But **why** do we think these things? Why do we identify with some random pixels on a screen? That's *clearly* not us! 
The posited answer is [[suture]].
