*[ [[Category - note taking]] ]*

After learning one of the most [[reading retention | horrifying facts]], I've been trying to change my reading habits. 

I've been reading different papers for a while, but I think reading in a more structured way is much more beneficial. 

I think it's important to use the modern tech sphere [[note taking principles]] (ex. Atomic Notes) with a mix of the old-school tactics like "explain in your own words". 

Which is why I'm currently going to use the following template, from what I've researched online. 

It will be in the form of questions posed to myself at the end of a reading. 

## Can I summarize the meaning of this text in my own words?
*Summary of the paper, the Feynman style method*

## Can I explain it in the simplest terms?
*Elevator pitch to small child*

##  What are the gaps in my knowledge?
*Summary of further reading for me. Do I need to dissasemble my understanding of this subject and oil it to put it back together?*

## Can I connect the core ideas to other core ideas I do understand?
*Any atomic notes? Anything to densely interlink the wiki some more?*
