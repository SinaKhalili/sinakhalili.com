*[ [[films I have seen]] ]*

The classic masterpiece [man with a movie camera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019760/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). Incredible how literally every time I watch a classic I go in expecting the worst and like clockwork :surprised-pikachu: *how did they make this in {{year}}! we donâ€™t even do some of this stuff today!* 

I should really learn to stop underestimating but I never do. 

I especially like the shots of the woman blinking and the blinds blinking. Then the shots of the poor and the rich. Perfecto.
