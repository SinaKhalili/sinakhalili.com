Taken from this [article](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230). 

# Identify
Write the name of the subject you're trying to learn. Write it at the top of page, it is your north star âœ¨ 

# Teach
Now you should try to teach it to yourself, in the simplest terms and as briefly as possible. Hopefully this will...

# Find knowledge gaps
Where are your assumptions? Where are you not filling in your thoughts? What's missing? ***This is where the learning happens, btw.***

# Organize and simplify
Now *tell a story*, maybe using [[screenwritng]] principles ðŸ˜› to do this, organize and simplify. If required, create new notation, draw, talk.

## Other takeaways
Draw on your passions. They are a source of insipiration.
