[[On demand culture | Tyron]] lays out two types of mobility: 

*Spatial*, which is when we have freedom to move about from platform to platform. For example iPad to TV to laptop. 

*Temporal*, which is when we have the freedom to watch whatever part, fast-forward, rewind, and anything else. 

Note that both of these freedoms are non-existent in a traditional movie theatre.
