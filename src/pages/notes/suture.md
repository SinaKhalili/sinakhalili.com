*[ [[psychoanalytic film theory]] ][ [[Category - Film]] ]*

Suture, meaning stitching. These are techniques used by film and filmmakers to make us forget that there's a camera in the shot doing all the filming.

The collapsing, the congruence of the cinema's “forms of looking”. Those are

1. The camera recording the profilmic event (whatever is on screen)
2. The audience viewing the final product
3. The actors looking on set, in the world of illusion

The synthesis of these three things gives the audience suture. You can use [[editing]] and other [[Filmmaking techniques]] to achieve this collapse, which thereby Suture.

Suture *makes* us identify with the characters on screen. And remember **we don't chose who we identify with** the filmmakers makes that choice for us. This is what motivated [[feminist film theory]] (the lack of female identification).
