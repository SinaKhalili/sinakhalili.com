A form of thinking and reasoning that starts with an axiomatic set of given constrains and moves forward in logical steps. 

This is much like [[mathematical logic]]. Instead of starting with what is available, distill the essence of the idea into it's root component, and proceed from there. 

This stands a bit in opposition to [[think by analogy]].
