### Thinking in graphs and patterns
I read a [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) quote once, which I cannot find again so it's very possible that he never said this but anyways it resonated with me. Paraphrased, it was something like

> If you keep seeing the same patterns in vastly different circumstances, then you could be witnessing a deeper truth about the universe. 

This quote is also related to [[abstraction]]. 

Here are some of my collected patterns. Most of them I don't understand in all their depth, but this is an ever-evolving wiki. Check the **backlinks** for a full list.

Our brains are pattern-recognizers. If you want to think better, you might want to recognize better patterns. 

But what is a pattern?

The structuralists would argue it's an abstract structure defined in terms of what it's not (ex. what is a tree? it is a not-bush, not-mountain, not-bright red, etc.)

The poststructuralists might argue that this not-something line of thought is infinite and leads to eating itself. They might be right.

In any case, **connections** are just as important as the things themselves. Put another way, **links** are first-class citizens, and should be treated as such.
