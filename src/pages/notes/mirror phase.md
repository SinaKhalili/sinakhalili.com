The [mirror stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_stage) is described as the time at which children gain the ability to percieve themselves in a mirror. 

Basically this means that they recognize that somewhere outside themselves is *they themselves*. 

In a way they lose their [[headlessness]]. In fact, I'd go on to say [[headlessness]] a lot about regaining what is lost in the mirror stage.

So what *is* lost in the mirror stage? 

Lacan says that once we identify with our own image, we have now become self-alientated. (Basically, we lose [[oneness]]). 

This is the birth of the ego. Lacan calls this the *Ideal-I*.

Can we eventually [[egodeath | kill]] the I?
