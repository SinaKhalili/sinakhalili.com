*[ [[Category - Programming]] ]*

So I just read a bunch of articles on an absolutely fantastic programming blog. I love finding these, they're like little treasures for me. 

This one is called https://fasterthanli.me and it's by this author/programmer where the writing is patreon supported, so you know it's quality. 

The articles I read were: 

## NTLM hashing in TV shows
Where the author, Amos, goes through the process of what a school hacker would have had to go through to crack a bunch of school passwords. 

He assumes  they'd be using some sort of Windows Server NT and proceeds to walk through: how to get the hash file, decrypting it, getting l0phtcr4ck to run on it, and trying to break the hash. 

He also covered working with rainbow tables. 

I felt a little thrill since I always kind of wanted to be a "high school hacker" character in high school, and when he used Ubuntu as live CD to steal the hash, I was like *I also Kali-Linux Live- CD'd in my highschool!!* although I couldn't steal the hashes. 

On second thought, my school had *auto-generated* passwords! Which nobody changed. If I had a hash db, and a couple of lines of python **boy** it would have been lights out. We can dream. 

## A new website
In this [post](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-new-website-for-2020), Amos, walks through his making of a new static site generator just for him. 

Personal note, I love these blog posts where the creator continues to make adjustments, finds errors, fixes/hacks something together and moves along. It's the [[hero's journey]].
