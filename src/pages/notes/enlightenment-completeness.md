In [[complexity theory]], there is a concept of [[reduction]], which (at a high level) is reducing one problem to another such that if you were to solve one, the other would also be solved (by using the same methodology you used to solve the first one). 

If a bunch of problems are reducable to one another, we call the “class” of problems “complete”. 

Why restrict this to [[Category - Computer Science | computer science]] though? 

I propose a new problems class: enlightenment completeness. 

We know there are many routes reach [[enlightenment]], and all of them are weirdly paradoxical. Budhism, religion, secular meditation, etc. 

I propose that if you understand one of the methods of reaching elightenment, (say, the Headless Way) then you can just reduce the same ideas to other fields by switching up the jargon.
