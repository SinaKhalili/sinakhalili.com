First of all, thanks for using this site. I really appreciated your visit here. 

For more of a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù check out [[philosophy of this site]] 

Basically, I'm trying to make the site easier to parse and find connections with by using *visual cues*, *shortcuts*, and *dense linking*. Hopefully this will spur more thought or save some time.

### Linking
The **right bar** (bottom on mobile) has pages that link **back** to the current page. This often called a *backlink* and can be a very useful companion. **This is arguably the single most crucial point which makes the rest of the system usable. ** 

To get in the habit of using the backlinks, use the backlink instead of your browser "back" button üîô, since wherever you came from will by definition have a backlink to the page that you're on (unless you used the right-side nav, in which case use the back button). 

This is what makes is possible to [[think in graphs]] instead of  having to [[think linearly]]. Check the backlinks section often for related topics.

You can always use the Home button on the **left bar** (top on mobile) to go back to the [[index]]. If the index gets big enough, I'll make meta-pages for categories. 

The current page (obviously) will link **out** to other links in the content itself. 

I want to encourage clicking links as much as possible, so after hundreds of hours researching test subjects in a small lab in south america, after doing countless unspeakable tasks, an optimal link-clicking encouragement was found.

There's a satisfying jiggle on my head every time an internal link is clicked. 

Hopefully that'll really push you to click that next internal link.

### Visual Cues
**Internal** links, like [[How to use this site | this]], which are links that **stay on this domain** (sinakhalili.com), are *not* annotated in any way.

**External** links, for example [this link to a very scientific analysis website](https://www.famousdetails.com/douglas-hofstadter/), are tagged with an emoji (namely, this notebook emoji üìù), and have **darker shade**. 

Some **external** links are annotated with a **symbol**, because their website or their website creator is relevant, cool, or beautiful.

For example the website where I stole this from, [Gwern](https://gwern.net).

Or for example the üêê website, [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org).

For more examples, see [[symbol link dump]].


What a great and wonderful time you will have, skipping the line of the hover-click and deciding in a single moment whether to click that link.
