*[ [[Category - note taking]] ]* 

I once read that we only retain ten percent of what we read. I was horrified. Then I started doing some research and surprise, turns out it's totally bogus. 

Phew. I knew *I* retained *way more* than that. I spend the better part of my life reading so I didn't want to hear I just wasted 90% of it. 

Ha! Imagine that. Only 10%. Lol. 

If it was really only 10% then how come I can recall at least 50% of the any recent recent thing I read? Let's see it was ... [that Montaigne book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624457-how-to-live?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=oyHS8wgW7N&rank=2). Ok so Montaigne invented the essay, big on skepticism. Kind of a stoic. Famously said "[[I quote others in order the better to express myself.]]" Talked about his dong. And uh... he uh... his longest essay is the *apology* and is several times larger than all the others and ... he had some interesting things to say about the new world and ... uh ... 


*fuck.*

It's true. 

Oh god.
