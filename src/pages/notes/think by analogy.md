We can really only think by analogy.

This was the thesis of the Hofstaders book [Surfaces and Essences](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711871-surfaces-and-essences). 

I've only read a bit of the book but also some summaries. 

It's analogy all the way down. In essence, a word can have an infinite number of meanings.

We can also be in an infinite number of situations. We can only draw on limited resources. 

We must then reason by analogy.

We put to much power on words. Praise be the almighty [[Wittgenstein]] came and saved us.

This stands somewhat in opposition to [[Semantic knowledge tree]] and [[first principles thinking]]
