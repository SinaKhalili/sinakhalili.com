When you write about film, it's called film theory. Related to [[Film analysis]]. I'm still not sure how much of a role it makes in [[Filmmaking techniques | filmmaking]], but it's interesting nonetheless. 

## Types
Thre are two types of film theory: 
[[classical film theory]] | [[contemporary film theory]]

Note that contemporary is actually just anything after the 1960's, which is not really that contemporary. Lol.
