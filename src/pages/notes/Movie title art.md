*[ [[Category - Film]] ][ [[Filmmaking techniques]] ]*

So here's something I totally didn't appreciate until now: 
Move title sequences. 

And there's a huge [website](https://www.artofthetitle.com/) dedicated to just that. Time to waste the rest of my day.

This is actually a big deal, since the right font and design can really set the tone for the rest of your film. And tone-setting is like most of what film is.

Anyways I read this great interview with Josh Safdie and his design team on the Uncut Gems title sequence, and it was super enlightening. I really like how they show process of selecting a good sequence, and the work they did for the opal-colonoscopy segment.

Some standout quotes:

On the use of "class" in the film:
> Totally. I believe that the micro is in the macro and vice versa. I think that’s been proven physically. I mean, when you look at the formation of the cosmos and the formation of an atom, they’re almost identical.
> You can only see his purpose in contrast to the emptiness of the universe. At the heart of a capitalist world like the one we all live in, but in particular consumerism and materialism, you have the material. The material is what binds us to the beginning of time.

Effects worker Hassan Rahim on chosing the right typeface:
>  My process around type is I stick to the classics — it’s really simple. All the typefaces I use are usually from the ’20s through the ’70s, that’s pretty much it. There’s not a typeface in the last 20 years that I can’t live without. 

Pretty interesting... I wonder if most of these typefaces are free? If their copyright is expired, could you just always use free and old fonts? 

Finally I learnt a new word from this interview "cinephilic director". These are directors that are also huge fans of movies. You gotta love it.
