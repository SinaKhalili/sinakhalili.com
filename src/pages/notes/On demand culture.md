*[ [[Film analysis]] ]*

In this paper, which is a chapter of the book [On deman culture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17032500-on-demand-culture?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Hvp2VLv6A7&rank=1) Chuck Tyron lays out the idea of the “Make any room your TV room”. 

The paper starts with a description of advertisements for movie services. As technology has progressed, we've seen a trend: from movies being a large occasion for the whole family to becoming an [[rise of individualism | individual]] act. We now have our films “on demand”.

This is has led to increased spectator freedom, which leads to increased [[mobility]].

The [[language artifact]]: *watching TV shows* doesn't mean physically watching shows on a television set per se.

Modern Hollywood cinema could be characterized as “cinema of the user”. Digital cinema is the [[regimes of cinema | thrid regime]] of cinematic storytelling.
