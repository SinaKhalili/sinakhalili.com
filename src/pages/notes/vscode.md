Vscode is the perfect middle ground between [[vim]] and [[emacs]]. I think it makes reading code really nice, and has a very strong community. Not (nearly) as much of a whole deal as elisp, but a lot of the settings require no tweaking. 

Honestly, since it uses the golden [[readline commands]] sometimes it just feels like Emacs. 

## Shortcuts
`command-P` : pick a file (like `command-O` in Obsidian)
`command-shift-P` : execute a command (like M-x in emacs)

## Tips
If *nothing* is selected, what ever action (copy, cut) will affect the whole line. This is better than command-L!
