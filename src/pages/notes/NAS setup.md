Fell into a random blog hole and ended up learning about NAS. I've always been a fan of self-hosting, but at a distance. I still don't self host anything, but I think Iâ€™d like to start sometime, since the degree of freedom and ease of use is just great. 

Anyways the main post I read one [this one](https://blog.briancmoses.com/2019/03/diy-nas-2019-edition.html) which is really in-depth article about setting up NAS home system which is definitely more "power user" than I thought it would be. 

I think I'm going to need to get into NAS storage soon through, for video files. I still want to get into [[Filmmaking techniques | filmmaking]] and I know that those video file size just absolutely blow up. 

1 take home: use 1GB of RAM per TB of space.
