Ah, graphics. This is the one computer area I haven't really learned anything about for some reason. I like math, and I like coding, and I like movies but for some reason never got into graphics. But that changes *now*. Well actually no, but I did read some cool stuff about it and I might implement my own graphics functions for fun.
