*[ [[Category - Anti-patterns]] ]*

The key difference about anti-patterns compared to regular bad habits are that they have solutions, so the key is in *identification* rather than *prevention*. 

I.e. smoking is a bad habit, and the smoker knows this. The difficulty in quitting is **not** one of identification. The difficulty is following through with quitting. 

An anti-pattern on the other hand is one like [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law): 
> adding more resources to project **slows the project down** if it's already late in the project. This is from the coordination overhead.

With knowledge of this anti-pattern, we can avoid it. Identification was major hurdle, not follow-through.
