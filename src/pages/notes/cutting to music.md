Cut the video to the underlying music. 

Doesn’t necessarily mean cutting on the *specific* music note drops (although you [totally can](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)). You can be more subtle, for example:
Pacing: If the music is fast, make quick cuts. Covered in [[soviet montage techniques]]. 

### No music?
From a [video on This Guy Edits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-7rHjqdk8&ab_channel=ThisGuyEdits), Sven talks about when not to use music, such as in the movie Atomic Blonde, where it was more impactful without the music. 

The main takeaways were: 
1. Cut to music afterwards, since music can mask bad editing and you won't catch it. Counterpoint: You can use music to *inspire* an edit, but still remember to cut without music afterwards.
2. Don't use temporary sounds you can’t get the license to.
3. Use music that isn’t necesarily in the genre of the movie
4. If the editing is correct, any music will work.
