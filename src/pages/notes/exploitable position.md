*[ [[Category - Anti-patterns]] ]*

A position in which you're vulnerable to doing something against your ideals. 

For example: 

[[parasocial]] relationships can make you exploitable to give money to your "friend"

Putting yourself in a tempting situation (like buying a bunch of unhealthy foods, when you don't want to gain weight)

Making a bad move in chess, on purpose, hoping the opponent won't take advantage

### Solution

You must flee! Flee from the position like prisoner who just broke his chains!
