The importance of studying cinema in the global context. 
Is it possible to decenter Hollywood? What do we gain or lose when we do so?

## Thesis
Yes it is possible, just as we've decentered philosophy from math, realism from art, or even knowledge from books, we can decenter Hollywood from film which will be a symbiotic relationship of story.

We gain the ability to Identify with material, not bounded by an invisible veil of the OTHER. 

We gain a new appreciation of the arts of other nationalities *and* benefit Hollywood itself by way of an unbiased look, give foreign nationalities a voice giving them confidence to make more films.

We have to careful in this decentering as it's not a rejection which is actually a *re*centering.

## Examples

Marlina the murderer in four acts

Hollywood to foreign:
Uses aspects of hollywood (the western).
Uses aspects of their own nationality
This is a film about Indonesian feminism to *this is a film about feminism*.

Black Girl

Foriegn to hollywood:
This is an *African* film of struggle to this is a film about *African struggle* to
*This is a film about struggle*. 

## Conclusion

Film needs to abstracted properly in order for film-goers to better identify, expand and enjoy film. Moreover, filmmakers work better when they see films from everyone.
