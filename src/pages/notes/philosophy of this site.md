## Philosophia

The *raison d'être* (🥖💋) of this site is (1) to store my knowledge in some external medium, and (2) be a scratchpad for thought.

### 1: Personnal Knowledge Management

The “PKM” on the left hand, where it says “Sina’s PKM” stand for Personnal Knowledge Management, which is basically just a process for storing new knowledge. The wikipedia article [kinda sucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) though (parenthetical citations, seriously?).

In case you're not up to date on this trend, it's a bit of zeitgeist thing to do in tech/researcher sphere. Some people call it creating your "second brain" or having a "[zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)" or a "personal wiki". 

Basically, its mix of [[note taking principles | principles]] and [[second brain systems | systems]] on how to [[take good notes]]. I've tried to [[Category - note taking | take notes on it]] (how meta). 

The idea is that if you follow the above principles, you'll benefit yourself by [[think in graphs | making connections]] (because of all the linking) and you'll benefit others by [[sharing knowledge]]. 

In addition to the stubby-toe-size wiki objective-style notes, I want this to be a dumping ground for more nuanced thought, like things people would actually read. 

I hope to make partially formed thoughts here and move them [to my blog](https://blog.sinakhalili.com) when I get the chance.
