*[ [[Category - Film]] ][ [[Category - Aphorism]] ]*

These are truisms, also known as aphorisms, also just quotes, that I’ve collected with regards to film. My own comments afterwards.

> What young directors don’t understand is that, yes, you can learn fimmaking at the click of a button, and you can order the equipment at the click of a button, but you can’t make a film at the click of a button. It takes dedication and work. - [Wolfcrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0FTlHBXDM0&ab_channel=wolfcrow)

The little passage at the end of this video I think hits upon an important point: just because we reduce the friction around a subject, especially a creative task, doing the thing itself **doesn’t become easier**. That’s why Kirosawa and Godard are still shinning examples of art today. Their talent didn’t age. 
I always thought “if our tech is so much better, why arent *we* so much better?”. This is why. Reducing the surrounding friction does not magically create art. See also [[unique perspective overconfidence]]
