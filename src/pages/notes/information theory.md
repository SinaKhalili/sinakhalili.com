[Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) is the study of information. What it is, it's limits, and more. 

During my time as a co-op at Canalyst I one day walked over to the VPL to see what books on computer science I could find. I stumbled upon a book called "[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8701960-the-information?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=LficmB4dat&rank=1)" by author James Gleick. It was profound.

I find it to be one of the more fascinating aspects of computer science.
