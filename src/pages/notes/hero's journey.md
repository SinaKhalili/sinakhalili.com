The [hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) is a story structure of the archetypical novel or film or video game. It's used in [[screenwritng]].

Basically, it works in three stages and models the enter and exit of the hero into a *special world*. 

1. **Departure**: The hero is living in the ordinary world, and gets a call to go on an adventure. This could be self-brought or he could initially refuse, and a mentor figure convinces him to follow the call.
2. **Initiation**: The hero enters the Special World, and must face a series of difficult tasks culminating in the climax. The hero puts into practice what he's learnt during the course of the adventure. He might get a reward for his action, sword, power, or "friends along the way"
3. **Return**: The hero return to the normal world, but is now a changed person. 

This structure has been replicated thousands of times, and every time I read about I find yet another story fits the mold perfectly. I guess something about the Special World lends itself well to creating stories. 

Dan Harmon later created a different tool, based on the hero's journey, called the story circle which hit a lot of the same notes.

The Dan Harmon version I feel is more self-oriented. The character wants something, and so they enter an unfamiliar situation to do the thing (initiation). 

In Rick and Morty they *literally* enter Special Worlds, which is fitting.
