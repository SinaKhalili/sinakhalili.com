I first read something similar to this in the book [vagabonding](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100247.Vagabonding?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=arUvYtu8o2&rank=1).

Struck a chord with me. Key word: **adequate**. 

The idea is that the enthousiasm acts as a shield against anything that would take away your gumption.

I imagine solving a millenium prize problem requires quite the enthousiasm. 
Making a personal wiki, a modest amount.
Crushing a crispy fall leaf? A minimal amount.

Reframe: 
“I can't do that” 👉 “I don't have an adequate amount of enthousiasm so as to accomplish that task”

Doesn't roll off the tongue as much, but what we've gained in verbosity we've also gained in perspective - a truly worthwhile trade!
