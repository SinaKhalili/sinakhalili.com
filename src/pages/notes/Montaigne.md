*[ [[Category  - Philosophy]] ]*

One of my favourite thinkers. He invented the [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne) as a literary genre, but seemed mostly concerned with just the wackiest things, like despite being a statesman and aristocrat, wrote at length about his cat and 🍆s, and pretty much anything he felt like. 

I read Sarah Bakewell‘s fantastic account of his life, [How to live](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624457-how-to-live?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=QiLUHWFkgd&rank=1). Highly reccomended!
