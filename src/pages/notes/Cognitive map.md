A [cognitive map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_map) is how we encode (acronym, picture, rote, text, image) store, recall, and decode information in our minds.

One idea of cognitive mapping is to offload processing to spatial memory by recalling information in a mind map.

You can also use different sights and sounds and even smells to quickly bring certain mind-pages into mind-RAM.
