Is a [psychological concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology)

The psychology of the idea that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. 

Summarized by this quote: 
>There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole. It is the hope of Gestalt theory to determine the nature of such wholes. - [Max Wertheimer](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-gestalt-psychology-2795808)

This is an interesting reverse-view of [[emergent behaviour]].

It has much to do about "leaps" of thought, and about [[unconscious thought]]. 

It's made up of a few "laws" or principles: 

1. Proximity: Things near each other are interpreted as related in some way
2. Similarity: Things that look like each other are interpreted as related in some way
3. Closure: We "fill in the gaps" in our head. Classic example: This picture of a zebra

(your brain fills in the missing parts)

4. Symmetry: Mind perceives symmetric objects as a unit
5. Common fate: Objects moving together are somehow related
6. Continuity: Elements along the same line of continuity are related
7. Past Experience: If you've seen it before it can override a past law. For example "LI" does appear as "U" (by the law of closure it should)
