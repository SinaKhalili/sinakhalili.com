*[ [[Category - Anti-patterns]] ]*

You should seek to appreciate those who can do things better than you try to *compete* especially if the situation is non-zero-sum.

For example ðŸ‘‰ better artist? more subscribers on YouTube? better career? etc. 

Seek to appreciate the way they got there, that they are there, and that you too could be there one day. 

Or maybe not. In essence, there is [[ oneness | no competition]].

> Come now, contrast a good man who is rolling in wealth with a man who has nothing, except that in himself he has all things; they will be equally good, though they experience unequal fortune. This same standard, as I have remarked, is to be applied to things as well as to men; virtue is just as praiseworthy if it dwells in a sound and free body, as in one which is sickly or in bondage. - Seneca
