After viewing a bunch of YouTube videos (shame) about budget filmmaking and indie films, I've come to the conclusion that getting a super nice camera with dope lenses and amazing lighting is simply not needed. Especially to start.

Since film is never about the technicals if they're not backing up the *story* and the *emotion*. And quite frankly, smartphone cameras are good. Audio can be done after.
